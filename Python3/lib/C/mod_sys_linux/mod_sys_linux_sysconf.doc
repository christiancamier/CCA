Function pathconf:
 pathconf(path, name) --> integer
 Gets a value for configuration option name for the filename path.

Arguments:
 * path: a string indicating an existing file or directory.
 * name: an integer indicating the desired value as follow:
	 - PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED:
	   Returns nonzero if the chown(2) call may not be used on this file where path refer to a directory.
	 - PC_MAX_CANON:
	   Returns the maximum length of a formatted input line where path refer to a terminal,
	 - PC_MAX_INPUT:
	   Returns the maximum length of an input line where path refer to a terminal,
	 - PC_NAME_MAX:
	   Returns the maximum length of a filename in the directory path.
	 - PC_NO_TRUNC:
	   Returns nonzero if accessing filenames longer than _POSIX_NAME_MAX generates an error.
	 - PC_PATH_MAX:
	   Returns the maximum length of a relative pathname when path is the current working directory.
	 - PC_PIPE_BUF:
	   Returns the size of the pipe buffer, path must refer to a FIFO.
	 - PC_VDISABLE:
	   Returns nonzero if special character processing can be disabled, where path must refer to a terminal.
         - PC_LINK_MAX:
	   returns the maximum number of links to the file where path refer to a directory,

Return value:
 The limit is returned, if one exists.  If the system does not have a limit for the requested resource, -1?
  If name is invalid an SystemError exception is raised.
