# Peter Gutmann overwriting method
# ================================
#
# The Gutmann method is an algorithm for securely erasing the contents
# of computer hard drives, such as files. Devised by Peter Gutmann and
# Colin Plumb, it does so by writing a series of 35 patterns over the
# region to be erased.
