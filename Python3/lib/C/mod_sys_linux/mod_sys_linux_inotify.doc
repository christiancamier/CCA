Class Inotify -- File system events monitoring object

Constructor:
 Inotify([flags]) -> Inotify object

 Arguments:
 * flags:  Inotify object behaviour flags
           An iterable (set, list, tuple) of one or more of the folowing values:
	   - IN_NONBLOCK : Set  the  O_NONBLOCK file status flag on the new open file description.
	                   Using this flag saves extra calls to fcntl(2) to achieve the same result.
           - IN_CLOEXEC  : Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file descriptor.
	                   See  the  description  of the O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for reasons why
			   this may be useful.
